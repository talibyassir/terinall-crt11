## Phase 1 — Data sources & market display

1. *Search & integrate crypto data APIs*

   * Gather direct, reliable APIs that provide crypto market data and metadata (prices, markets, logos). Examples to include: *CoinGecko* (market data & logos), *CoinMarketCap*, and each exchange’s public data APIs.
   * Add endpoints for *Binance, **Coinbase / Coinbase Pro, **Bybit*, and other major centralized exchanges (CEX).
   * Add decentralized exchange (DEX) data sources (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, etc.) where applicable.

2. *Logo / image assets*

   * Fetch and display coin/token logos and platform logos (exchanges, DEXs) in the UI.
   * Provide options to cache these assets and fallback images when unavailable.

3. *Live market feed*

   * Implement live market data (ticker, order book snapshots, recent trades). Use websockets where available (e.g., Binance) and fall back to polling when necessary.
   * Present a “live market” panel/widget for quick view.

## Phase 2 — Trading: buy & sell (DEX + CEX)

1. *DEX trading integration*

   * Integrate common DEXs (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, others) via their router contracts / APIs to enable on-chain swap executions.
   * Add wallet connectivity (e.g., WalletConnect, MetaMask) so users can sign transactions and trade from their wallets.
   * Provide UI flows for swap: select token pair, set slippage, gas price, confirm, and submit.

2. *CEX trading integration*

   * Integrate CEX trading via the exchange APIs (Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, etc.). Use their authenticated REST/websocket APIs for order placement, order status, balances.
   * Support the platform-specific API keys and permissions flow for the user to connect (store keys securely).

3. *Error handling & reconciliation*

   * Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures, rate limits, network/transaction failures, and mismatches between on-chain and CEX states.
   * Provide retry strategies, user-facing error messages, and logging/alerts for operators.
   * Reconcile orders and balances periodically and surface inconsistencies in the UI.

## Phase 3 — Fixes, home page & layout

1. *Home page problems*

   * Inspect the home page; identify non-working features and restore them so each UI element performs its intended function (loading, updating, navigation, etc.).
   * Create or repair layout templates and responsive behaviors.

2. *Systematic issue triage*

   * Test and review components *one by one*. For each component:

     * Describe its function.
     * List observed problems.
     * Propose corrective actions and severity/priority.

---

## Widgets & UI configuration

1. *Resizable, flexible widgets*

   * Make widgets resizable from all sides (drag-to-resize) and support snapping/grids so users can enlarge from any direction.
   * Ensure widgets support multiple content types (live tickers, charts, order forms, logos, market depth, etc.).

2. *Advanced settings for every widget*

   * Every widget must include advanced configuration options (data source selection, refresh intervals, display options, caching, thresholds, etc.) with no exceptions.
   * Provide a consistent settings panel UX: basic vs advanced tabs; save presets; import/export widget configs.

3. *Creativity & polish*

   * Improve visuals and UX where possible: layout presets, drag/drop, theming, compact/dense modes, keyboard accessibility.
   * Add helpful microcopy and confirmations for risky actions (e.g., executing large trades, using high slippage).

## Quality, security & operational notes

* *Security:* Secure storage of API keys, protect user secrets, follow best practices for back-end credential handling and encryption.
* *Rate limits:* Respect exchange rate limits; implement back-off and caching.
* *Testing:* Unit tests for integrations, end-to-end tests for trading flows, and simulated environments for DEX/CEX trade testing.
* *Monitoring & logs:* Track API failures, latency, transaction statuses, and user-facing errors. Provide dashboards for operators.

## Deliverables (example)

* Inventory/list of integrated APIs and endpoints (with brief description and usage).
* Implemented live market widget(s) showing price, logo, order book, trades.
* Wallet-connect-enabled DEX swap widget (Uniswap/PancakeSwap).
* CEX order placement integration for at least Binance + one other (Coinbase/Bybit).
* Comprehensive error handling & reconcilers.
* Fully resizable/configurable widgets with advanced settings UI.
* Bug report & fixes applied to homepage and a step-by-step triage report for remaining components.

If you want, I can now:

* Turn this into a technical task list with tickets and estimated implementation steps, or
* Produce the exact API endpoints and code snippets for Binace, CoinGecko, Uniswap and WalletConnect to start implementation.
